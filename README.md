## Session for aocd package

Session token needed for the package to work: `export AOC_SESSION=ABCD1324`, get that from browser cookies. (More info: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1)

The package also introspects the current day from the path/name of the script that contains the solution, so be careful with namings: `10_1_asd.py` is not good, use `10_a_asd.py` instead.
